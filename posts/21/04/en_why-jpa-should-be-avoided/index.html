Somewhere as far back as 2005 or 2007, an interviewer asked me how I’d go about mapping the 1-N relationship with Hibernate.
”I have no idea what Hibernate is,” I said.</p><p>Then in 2008 I got a job at Softage to work on a project based on Swing and Hibernate.
I had zero commercial experience with either, so it seemed to me I was terrible at the job.
I spent a few weeks worrying my head over it and then quit.</p><p>No Java developer can really eschew having to work with JPA altogether, though.
So naturally, I too had to live through with it.
I’ve had to dig up and fix a mountain of bugs and performance issues caused by the coding style JPA enforces.
To do that, I had to understand how JPA works.
Still, I’ll never get back the hours of doing that.
That’s why I hate JPA.</p><p>In this article, I’ve discussed both the facts and my own experience.
It’s up to you to interpret these.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_jpas_philosophy>JPA’s Philosophy</h2><aside class="admonition-block note" role=note><h6 class="block-title label-only"><span class=title-label>Note:</span></h6><p>To be fair, 90% of my experience with JPA is limited to Hibernate.
I’ve also tried EclipseLink, although it has the very same problems.
So in this article, I’m using JPA and Hibernate almost interchangeably.
However, JPA’s main problems all stem from mutable entities and lazy loading.
These are inherent to its specification, so I doubt it’s possible to completely avoid them.</p></aside><p>Here’s my loose take on JPA’s philosophy: "Forget the database–just declare your own object model. Work with it as if it’s already in the memory in full. We’ll take care about getting all objects saved in the database."</p><p>Perhaps the actual philosophy behind JPA is different–I couldn’t find anything in my research.
However, that’s certainly what the folk version of it sounds like.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_hibernates_simplified_model>Hibernate’s Simplified Model</h2><figure class=image-block><img src=/posts/21/04/en_jpa-model.svg alt="en jpa model"><figcaption>Figure 1.

Hey mom, no boilerplate code you’d usually need to work with a database!
It’s almost like you could hand this task over to a Java coding bootcamp graduate, and they’d start delivering value from the go.
However, you can only get by with this while working on the very first version of a simple system used by you and your QA.
It’s only when the system gets under any load and starts to evolve you can see this design crumbling.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_jpas_advantages>JPA’s Advantages</h2><p>Everything has both pros and cons.
I must admit there are some bright sides even to JPA.</p><p>With no doubt, it’s the most commonly used database access solution for Java.
This implies three more upsides.</p><div class=ulist><ul><li>There’s a multitude of free JPA learning materials for any level.
As long as you’re writing idiomatic JPA code, you’ll easily find a solution for any problem you might have online.</li><li>It’s easy to hire a developer who’s familiar with JPA. You can just get anyone, and there’ll be a 99% chance they have at least some experience with JPA.</li><li>JPA is supported by everyone and everywhere. For example, Kotlin has made a dedicated <a href=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/no-arg-plugin.html>plugin</a> for JPA compatibility.</li></ul></div><p>What’s more, JPA is using the imperative object-oriented paradigm everyone’s familiar with.
Need someone who can work with JPA? Anyone on the market will fit the bill.
This model is genuinely easy-to-use, and in most cases will help you come up with a perfectly smooth solution.</p><p>Given as an isolated task, JPA can handle saving and loading entity graphs into the database full well.</p><p>JPA is also good at smoothing down the differences between several SQL dialects, which comes handy if your project’s supposed to support multiple DBMSes.
However, this only works as long as you can stick with the lowest common denominator of these dialects.
As a rule, though, every dialect’s best—performance-wise—features are usually unique to it.</p><p>Finally, it’s a solid solution–I can’t recall facing any bugs with Hibernate.</p><p>There are downsides to everything as well, though, and JPA has quite a lot of these.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_jpas_issues>JPA’s issues</h2><p>The root of all JPA’s problems is paradigmatic, not technical.
JPA attempts to make it as if there’s no database at all.
Particularly, it tries to take the developer’s mind off the fact that all changes must be reflected in the database.
Essentially, DMBSes are state mutations managers.
Therefore, JPA has no other choice but to use the imperative programming model.
That’s the only way you can pass a "POJO" to the app and keep track of its state mutations.
So while pursuing this, JPA excludes the more ergonomic declarative model.</p><p>JPA undermines both design and performance.
First, let’s take a look at how JPA can jeopardize software design.</p><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_default_constructors>Default constructors</h3><p>JPA requires that all entity classes include constructors by default:</p><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>The entity class must have a no-arg constructor.</p><footer>— <cite>JSR 338: JavaTM Persistence API; Version 2.2; "2.1 The Entity Class, " https://github.com/javaee/jpa-spec/blob/master/jsr338-MR/JavaPersistence.pdf</cite></footer></blockquote></div><p>Note that default constructors are an antipattern and a ticking bomb, as they allow for invariant-violating objects.
They also cause <a href=https://azhidkov.pro/posts/21/01/210119-effects/#_временная_связность>temporal coupling</a>.
Look <a href=https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/05/30/DesignSmellDefaultConstructor/>here</a> for more details.</p><p>You can partly avoid this problem by making the default constructor package private and marking it as @Deprecated.</p><p>I’ve never seen anyone but me adhere to this practice, though.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_classes_must_be_open_for_inheritance>Classes must be open for inheritance</h3><p>JPA requires entity classes to be open for inheritance:</p><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>The entity class must not be final</p><footer>— <cite>JSR 338: JavaTM Persistence API; Version 2.2; "2.1 The Entity Class"</cite></footer></blockquote></div><p>However, you must either design and document your classes for inheritance or prohibit it.
I’ll quote the classics here: <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997>Effective Java</a>, chapter "Item 19: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it."</p><p>It would take much more effort to design a class for inheritance than to define a data structure with a bunch of fields, as well as setters and getters for these.</p><p>I’ve never seen a JPA Entity designed with inheritance in mind.</p><p>Although JPA’s entity inheritability can cause potential problems, I’ve never encountered any in my experience.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_objects_must_be_mutable>Objects must be mutable</h3><p>JPA can’t work with immutable objects "By Design," and mutability is inherent to its specification:</p><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>An update to the state of an entity includes both the assignment of a new value to a persistent property or field of the entity as well as the modification of a mutable value of a persistent property or field</p><footer>— <cite>JSR 338: JavaTM Persistence API; Version 2.2; "3.2.4 Synchronization to the Database"</cite></footer></blockquote></div><p>If your entire model is mutable, though, you get all the issues with:</p><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li><a href=https://azhidkov.pro/posts/21/01/210119-effects/#_временная_связность>temporal coupling (rus)</a>;</li><li><a href=https://azhidkov.pro/posts/21/01/210119-effects/#_нелокальность_рассуждений>locality of reasoning (rus)</a>;</li><li><a href=https://azhidkov.pro/posts/21/01/210119-effects/#_конкурентное_программирование>concurrent development (rus)</a>.</li></ol></div><p>To minimize its abstraction <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction>leaks</a>, JPA needs to make sure an object in memory only corresponds to just one row in the table.
So if instead of mutating an object you create a new instance of it with an updated state, JPA will treat it as a new object. Naturally, it’ll also link it to a new table row.
If you try to save this new instance, JPA will attempt to insert it. This will cause a primary key uniqueness violation.</p><p>You can partly avoid this by making your entities immutable and only ever performing updates with UPDATE queries.
However, this will only work as long as you have to update just one object.
Things get much more complicated if you’re working with an immutable object graph, though. You’ll need to manually write the queries of each type and–manually as well–run the UPDATE queries through the graph.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_all_code_becomes_side_effect_code>All code becomes side effect code</h3><p>JPA transforms virtually all of your code into side effects code.</p><p>Every getter can get the query executed or start doing so tomorrow.
Every function call can mutate your object and add a new UPDATE request to a transaction.</p><p>You can read more about all the issues that come with side effect code <a href=https://azhidkov.pro/posts/21/01/210126-fraud-functions/>here (rus)</a>.</p><hr><p>Let’s now take a look at some performance issues JPA can bring.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_lazy_loading>Lazy loading</h3><p>JPA is big on lazy loading.
It’s the default option for OneToMany and ManyToMany relations. Also, in the JPA world, lazy loading is considered <a href=https://thorben-janssen.com/hibernate-best-practices/#10_Don8217t_use_FetchTypeEAGER>"the best practice</a>."</p><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if lazy loading was responsible for 1 percent of global energy consumption.
Lazy loading was the reason behind 90% of performance issues I’ve had to deal with in JPA-based projects.</p><p>Time and time again, I’d greatly improve on the performance of JPA-based system’s parts with this algorithm.</p><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>Count the number of queries run by the code.</li><li>Your heart will miss a beat once you see a few hundred queries instead of just a few. Get it back in rhythm.</li><li>Throw all your code away. Write a bunch of queries manually. Write new code based off these.</li><li>Voila.</li></ol></div><p>I can only assume here, but I believe that’s what’s usually happening behind the curtains.</p><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>The developer needs to implement a new function ASAP.</li><li>In that part of the code where the new function is supposed to be, there already is an object with a getter returning a list that comprises all the necessary data.</li><li>The developer invokes that getter and loops through it.</li><li><p>In ca. 60% of the time, the developer doesn’t realize that they’re adding a new request by invoking the getter.
By looping through it, they’re adding N more.</p><p>In 30% of the time they do realize that, but brush it off because <a href=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth>"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."</a></p><p>In 7% of the time they add a new task to the technical debt graveyard.</p><p>Finally, in just 3% of the time they take full responsibility, get the deadline extended, and come up with an effective solution.</p><p>In my experience, I usually have it rougly the same way in JPA projects. In the best-case scenario, I end up with a corresponding 60/0/30/10 percent distribution.</p></li><li>The developer repeats Step no. 3 a few times. Bonus points for using a bunch of nested loops with lazy loading. This way, the number of queries will show exponential growth.</li><li>The developer runs some tests using demo data with just a couple of rows in the table. No problems arise.</li><li>Voila! You’re now free to hire me so that I can fix all these performance issues.</li></ol></div><p>With lazy loading, you must always be on the lookout.
Every time you write something like <code>entity.getXXXs</code>, ask yourself whether this may cause a <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping>N+1 request</a> to pop up there.
Personally, I lack the self-discipline for that.</p><p>Speaking about lazy loading, we must also mention the infamous LazyInitializationException.
I still keep stumbling upon it in production apps so often you’d be surprised.</p><p>Finally, here’s a problem unique to JPA: it doesn’t offer convenient means to dynamically manage lazy loading.
You could use <code>NamedEntityGraph</code> in some cases. It’s quite cumbersome, though, so you’d be really tempted to get back to lazy loading.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_you_need_an_extra_query_to_refresh_entities>You need an extra query to refresh entities</h3><p>This issue is similar the <a href=#_objects_must_be_mutable>immutable objects one</a> mentioned above. You’ll face it once you need to refresh an entity based off a external DTO, e.g. one you got in a HTTP request.
There are two ways to do this in JPA.</p><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>The idiomatic way: run an extra SELECT query to put the object into PersistenceContext and mutate it.</li><li>The efficient way: use UPDATE again.</li></ol></div><p>The first way seems questionable from the efficiency standpoint.
The second one looks like you’re fighting the framework.
Wasn’t it supposed to make your life easier?</p><p>In theory, you could also store your entities in a HTTP session.
However, in the horizontal scaling era, this option is better left in theory.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_you_need_an_extra_query_to_reference_an_entity>You need an extra query to reference an entity</h3><p>Here’s the third problem that stems from the very same root.
Let’s say you need to create a new entity that references an existing one with a known ID.
There are two ways to do that in JPA: you can either run an extra query–thus sacrificing performance–or fight JPA.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_caching>Caching</h3><p>Basically, you can’t cache JPA entities.</p><p>If your entities have setters, they’ll be uncacheable, just because you won’t be able to synchronize the concurrent access to them.</p><p>Even if your JPA entities are immutable, being cached, they’ll turn useless once the transaction they were loaded into gets closed.
You’ll still be able to access the data within it, but you won’t be able to reference it.</p><p>Finally, for an entity with lazy fields, you’ll eventually get the LazyInitializationException.</p><hr><p>I’m sure this list will go on and on.
For now, I’ve just touched the very tip of the iceberg here.</p><p>It seems like JPA can be used without having to sacrifice either design or performance.
You’ll need to abandon writing idiomatic code, though, which eliminates all the advantages of using JPA.
This approach barely gets talked about, if ever, so learning materials are scarce.
Virtually all developers aren’t familiar with it, and maintenance can get tricky.</p><p>So naturally, we come to the question whether it’s worth it if we’re prioritizing design and performance for our system.
If the answer’s "no," what could be the possible alternatives?</p></section></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_jpa_alternatives>JPA Alternatives</h2><p>All the issues outlined above aren’t inherent to object relational mapping per se.
These problems are inherent to a very specific approach towards ORM.
They are but a natural consequence of it trying to emulate the work with objects within memory.</p><p>Other solutions exist where you don’t need to sacrifice design and performance for the sake of idiomatic code.
Some of these resemble JPA.</p><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_spring_data_jdbcr2dbc>Spring Data Jdbc/R2dbc</h3><p><a href=https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jdbc/docs/2.1.7/reference/html/#reference>docs.spring.io/spring-data/jdbc</a></p><p>Right now, I prefer working with databases via Spring Data Jdbc/R2dbc (SDJ).</p><p>This technology can tick some of the boxes that are commonly thought to be unique to JPA:</p><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>Those developers who are familiar with Spring Data JPA already know most of SDJ.</li><li>It’s still the good old Spring Data tech that can automagically generate implementations for methods such as <code>findByName(name: String)</code>.</li><li>It’s a 'reliable solution from a trusted vendor,' which makes it easier to sell to your client or CTO than other alternatives.</li></ol></div><p>Nonetheless, SDJ is quite ergonomic by design:</p><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>Spring Data JDBC aims to be much simpler conceptually, by embracing the following design decisions:</p><div class=ulist><ul><li>If you load an entity, SQL statements get run.

Constructor-only materialization is up to 30% faster than properties population.</li><li>Provide an all-args constructor — Even if you cannot or don’t want to model your entities as immutable values, there’s still value in providing a constructor that takes all properties of the entity as arguments, including the mutable ones, as this allows the object mapping to skip the property population for optimal performance.</li></ul></div><footer>— <cite>Spring Data JDBC Reference Documentation, https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jdbc/docs/2.1.7/reference/html/#mapping.general-recommendations</cite></footer></blockquote></div><p>What’s more, even though…​</p><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>All Spring Data modules are inspired by the concepts of “repository”, “aggregate”, and “aggregate root” from Domain Driven Design.</p><footer>— <cite>Spring Data JDBC Reference Documentation, <a class=bare href=https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jdbc/docs/2.1.7/reference/html/#jdbc.domain-driven-design>https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jdbc/docs/2.1.7/reference/html/#jdbc.domain-driven-design</a></cite></footer></blockquote></div><p>…​every single Spring Data JPA-based project I’ve ever encountered in the wild was nothing like that.

It can quickly provide you with a makeshift solution for problem at hands, though.</p><p>Since SDJ doesn’t have lazy loading, you won’t get away with this "normal practice."
