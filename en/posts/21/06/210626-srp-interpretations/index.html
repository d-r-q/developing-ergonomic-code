That’s because with SRP, there are at least five different formulas with three interpretations.

It’s one of the principles guiding Linux philosophy.
However, Martin himself says in his "Clean Architecture" that it has nothing to do with SRP:</p><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>It is too easy for programmers to hear the name and then assume that it means that every module should do just one thing.</p><p>Make no mistake, there is a principle like that.

For most of its development the Game class was handling two separate responsibilities.
It was keeping track of the current frame, and it was calculating the score.

I think there are much less conflicting interpretantions to the word "requirement" than there are to
the word "actor."
"Actor" per se isn’t the best word, as it’s usually understood as "the program’s user"—a definition
popularized by the UML.</p><p>In my formula, it’s clear why data storage modules should be separated from data presentation modules.
The former are specified by the DBA, and the latter by the UX designer.
It’s also clear why you should separate the modules responsible for implementing the CFO and COO
responsibilities.
The requirements for these are defined by different people from different departments.</p><p>This formula isn’t perfect as well, though.
First, infrastructure modules will be fulfilling at least two requirements, i.e. the functional and
the quality ones.
Second, I’ve never seen a project that would have the functional and the non-functional
requirements, stakeholder list, and stakeholder relations all clearly written out.</p><p>Neither this SRP formula nor any other one doesn’t provide software engineers with a guide on the
nuts and bolts of how they should be implementing the principle in their everyday work.
Perhaps it would be more useful to break SRP down into multiple down-to-earth recommendations?
For example:</p><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>form a directed acyclic graph of inter-module dependency;</li><li>separate the I/O (GUI included) from the business rules,</li><li>separate the code responsible for different functions of the system,</li><li>write tests.
In your tests, you should only mock external systems and create the system under test manually (as
opposed to with a DI container).</li></ol></div><p>These recommendations don’t require extensive planning ahead with defining the stakeholders and the
requirements.
It’s also easy to see whether you’re following these recommendations when writing your code.</p><p>These are much easier to use in day-to-day work for wider circles of software engineers.
They would also result in a system that’s reliable and easy to maintain.</p><p>I have one more recommendation apart from those listed above.
You should separate the "default library" (the domain) and the "scripts" (functions) of the application.
This is dicussed by both Martin in his Clean Architecture as the separation of entities and
interactors and Evans in his DDD as the separation of application and domain services.
Nether they nor I can provide any objective criteria that could allow to see whether the code
you’re writing adheres to this recommendation.
Therefore, I’m not listing it as a simple and clear one.</p></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_here_we_go_round_the_mulberry_bush>Here we go 'round the mulberry bush</h2><div class=image-block><img src=/posts/21/06/images/years-without-new-srp-version-en.jpg alt="years without new srp version en"></div><p><strong>SOLID relevance, 2020</strong></p><p>The constant change of SRP formulas and interpretantions could be explained with Martin’s own
understanding of SRP changing and evolving.
At first, SRP meant for him that we should separate the code by its responsibilities.
Then it occurred to him that the code should also be separated by implementation concerns.
Finally, Uncle Bob combined both under "people-based" code decomposition.</p><p>This was an excellent explanation of SRP history, all the way until Martin wrote his last post on SRP.
In that post, he went back to concerns-based code decomposition:</p><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>It is hard to imagine that this principle is not relevant in software.
We do not mix business rules with GUI code.
We do not mix SQL queries with communications protocols.</p><footer>— <cite>Robert C.

jumping back and forth between these code decomposition criteria:</p><figure class=table-block><figcaption>The history of SRP interpretations</figcaption><table class="frame-all grid-all stretch"><col style=width:11.1111%><col style=width:33.3333%><col style=width:55.5556%><thead><tr><th class="halign-left valign-top">Year</th><th class="halign-left valign-top">Source</th><th class="halign-left valign-top">Decomposition criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">2003</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Agile software development Principles Patterns and Practices</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Responsibilities and<br>a vague actor inkling*</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">2008</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Clean Code</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Responsibilities</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">2011</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">The Clean Coder</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Concerns</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">2014</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">The Single Responsibility Principle</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Responsibilities, concerns, and actor</td></tr><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top">2018</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Clean Architecture</td><td class="halign-left valign-top">Responsibilities and actor, +s

more example in the SRP chapter.</p><div class=image-block><img src=/posts/21/06/images/rectangle.png alt=rectangle></div><div class=quote-block><blockquote><p>Two different applications use the Rectangle class.
One application does computational geometry.
It uses Rectangle to help it with the mathematics of geometric shapes.
It never draws the rectangle on the screen.
The other application is graphical in nature.
It may also do some computational geometry, but it definitely draws the rectangle on the screen.</p><footer>— <cite>Robert C. Martin, Agile software development Principles Patterns and Practices</cite></footer></blockquote></div><p>Looking at this example (from 2021), we can conclude that different apps will have different users
(which are one kind of actors) and the draw and area methods serve for implementing the requirements of
different actors.</p><hr><p>** In the Clean Architecture, concerns separation is mentioned as well (the save method
defined by the CTO).
In this book, though, Martin isn’t explicitly discussing the need for concerns-based
decomposition.
Considering the quite unconventional usage of the word "actor," this explanation could be
interpreted as decomposition based on the users alone.
This would be a fourth SRP interpretation, albeit I’ve never encountered it in the wild.</p></aside><p>Responsibilities-based decomposition and implementation concerns-based decomposition aren’t two ways of laying out the same principle.
These are two different principles that lead to different results.</p><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id=_separation_of_responsibilities_separation_of_concerns>Separation of responsibilities != Separation of concerns</h3><p>You can separate SQL and JSP and still use the same code in different functions, as well as break
some users' functions while modifying some other users' functions.
Alternatively, you can get each user or each function of the system their own dedicated
microservice, as well as have just one method for json parsing, business rules, and SQL request execution.
You’ll end up with fragile code that’s painful to maintain, though.</p><p>Functionality implementation concerns and functionality per se are orthogonal axes of code decomposition.</p><p>SRP violates one of its own interpretations and mixes together various concerns of software design.
I have zero idea on why Uncle Bob would combine two different principles to make one.</p><p>Perhaps it took Martin himself some time to understand that code should be separated by both
responsibilitity and implementation concerns.
By the time he understood this, the SOLID had already taken off and become a brand no one would want
to lose.</p><p>Can we rely on a principle whose formula and interpretation both change every three years?
I don’t think so.</p></section></section><section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id=_we_need_new_principles>We need new principles</h2><p>To sum things up:</p><div class=ulist><ul><li>It isn’t quite clear what SRP even is.
Different developers mean different design principles by SRP.
Even Martin himself keep changing the formulas and the examples he’s using to define SRP.</li><li>The Single True Version of SRP I believe in isn’t viable to use in real life projects.
Because in real life projects, no one does the analytics this version would require.</li><li>Even if they did, the SRP ideal would still be an unattainable ideal.
That’s because a significant part of the code will have at least two reasons to change: namely, the
functionality requirements and the implementation method requirements.</li></ul></div><p>Even though SRP is the most questionable SOLID principle, the other four have their fair share
of problems and conflicting readings as well.
Therefore, I don’t think that SOLID as it is can be a good system design guideline.</p><p>Yet still, the SOLID contains quite a lot of good and useful ideas.
That’s why I’m not calling for it to be abolished altogether — I’m suggesting for it to be reinstated.
We should pick out the relevant ideas it contains, make these more specific, and supplement them
with best-practice examples.
Naturally, everything that has now lost its relevance should be deprecated.</p><p>Here’s the most important part: we shouldn’t pigeonhole ourselves by only using those principles
whose first letters can form up a pretty acronym.</p></section></article><br></section></div></main><script src=/js/app.js></script></body></html>
