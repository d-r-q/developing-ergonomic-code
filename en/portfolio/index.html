This was causing the app to be extremely unstable.</p><p>Because of the large-sized code base, I decided it would be more efficient to develop a Kotlin-powered tool based on the Java Debug Interface.

Their flagship products were based on Windows, but in spring 2018, they decided to also give Linux a try.
That’s why they went to me.
For the pilot project, they chose to make a prototype of a video capture system for a custom camera that would receive signals from one of their existing devices.</p><p>This project turned out to be one of the most fascinating and complex ones I’ve ever worked on.
First, it was the first–and so far the last–commercial experience I’ve had with C.
Second, I got the chance to do some work with hardware directly.
That’s a whole different experience :)
Finally, I tried my hand at multithreaded and network programming with a language that has no synchronized block or garbage collector.</p><p>The system’s workflow was supposed to look like this:</p><div class="olist arabic"><ol class=arabic><li>The system would listen for requests from a custom device connected to it via USB (we switched to a simple GPIO switcher later on);</li><li>Once it receives a command, the system beings to capture the video stream from a custom camera connected to it via CSI and save it to the drive.</li><li><p>There also was a separate HTTP server that would, on request, collect frames within a specified time interval and pack them into a zip archive.</p><p>The client asked for the server to be powered by C.

Native code per se is a tough nut to crack in terms of reverse-engineering.
Things get much harder if we’re talking native code generated from a code snippet written in a high-level dynamic language.</p><p>For licensing, I developed a license server and added a license check into the algorithm.</p><p>Finally, I developed a GUI with QT.

For that reason, I developed a DSL based on Kotlin Coroutines that allowed to describe the process of filling out a form in a declarative style.</p><p>While working on the scripts, I had to come up with a way to fill forms out automatically on websites powered by modern web frameworks.
Naturally, I had to do extensive research into the frameworks' structure to do so.</p><p>Initially, the client wanted an Android app only.
In a bunch of months of development, though, he decided he needs an iOS one as well.
I knew that the scripts were the project’s most expensive part.
For that reason, I decided that instead of porting these to iOS, I’d better take a risk and put both the DSL and the scripts into a multiplatform module.</p><p>I had encountered some issues while connecting the KMM module to the iOS app.
Still, I’m quite sure this decision saved my client around 50% to 100% of the project’s final cost.</p><figure class="table-block portfolio"><figcaption>Technologies</figcaption><table class="frame-all grid-all stretch"><col style=width:33.3333%><col style=width:33.3333%><col style=width:33.3334%><tbody><tr><td class="halign-left valign-top"><p>Kotlin</p><p>Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile</p><p>Kotlin Coroutines</p><p>JavaScript</p></td><td class="halign-left valign-top"><p>WebView</p><p>React</p><p>Angular</p><p>Vue.js</p></td><td class="halign-left valign-top"><p>Android</p><p>iOS</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><hr></section></section><section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id=threads><a class=link href=#threads>Brooma Service</a></h4><section class="doc-section level-4"><h5 id=_reingeneering_the_reporting_module><a class=link href=#_reingeneering_the_reporting_module>Reingeneering the reporting module</a></h5><p>One of Brooma’s products is Threads, an end-to-end solution for handling customer communication via chats and messengers.
In spring 2019, Brooma wanted Threads' report module reingeneered.
They didn’t have enough hands in-house for that back then, which is why they reached out to me.</p><p>Originally, the module had about 20 caching-related issues that were hard to diagnose.
It would consume too much memory when running, which was causing the main app to fail.</p><p>To solve the problem, I:</p><div class=ulist><ul><li>reverse-engineered the original module;</li><li>spawned it off into a separate process; and</li><li>set going a data streamline from the database server to the client browser via two apps powered by Spring Web MVC.</li></ul></div><p>Setting up the data streamline and interacting with JDBC directly allowed to resolve the original module’s problems, significantly improve on its performance, and fix all the memory-related issues.</p><p>The project took much longer than expected.
